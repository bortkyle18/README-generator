## Installation

  You will first need to clone this repository to your local computer. Once this is complete, use terminal inside the README-generator/develop directory and type in npm init into terminal. Next, type in npm install inquirer into terminal, as inquirer is needed for this application to run. Once this is complete, type in node index into terminal to run the application!

## Usage

  Once you type in node index into terminal (in the correct directory as mentioned above), follow the prompts provided. Answer ALL required questions and then any optional questions you would like. If you leave any optional sections blank, there will still be a title for that section, so it is recommended that you enter None. Once you complete all prompts, your README file should generate in the develop folder for you to use! The last step for you to complete is to copy and past this README file into your project folder for use! Enjoy and reach out to me (see questions section below) with any bugs you experience!
